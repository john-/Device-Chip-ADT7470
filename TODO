Confirm that the write functions shold not return anything

read_fan_rpm:  I am not chaining the future call to include reading the HIGHBYTE.  Seems odd to pass the return values down the chain.   Determine if there is a better way to do this.

How is the max_bitrate determined?   I don't see it in data sheet

Check rpm reading logic as I should consider Register 0x43 (fan pulses per revolution register)

Check rpm reading logic in conditions like fan is disconnected (shows 82 rpm currently)

Error handling when device is not available (powered down)
